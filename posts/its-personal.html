<h1>Personal Finance.. It's Personal</h1>

<p></p>


<!-- habits and behaviours -->
<!-- ex. can you use credit to earn points for spending, or will you get into cc debt -->
<!-- you work for your money, so make it work for you -->

  <h2>Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>what beliefs motivate our actions?</li>
  <li>before we can think about money and why we want to make a certain salary, we need to understand something much deeper</li>
  <li>for example, I have always been a saver but it took me a long time before I could admit to myself that I was saving because I always wanted to have kids, and I knew it would be important to have money to raise them</li>
  <li>before you can work on the money aspects of personal finance, you need to figure out and admit to yourself what's important to you</li>
  <li>maybe you care a lot about travelling while you're young or retiring early</li>
  <li>knowing what's important will help you with the next step of setting goals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Habits</h2>
<ul>
<li>before getting a credit card, for example, think about your habits and tendencies</li>
<li>maybe you have a habit of spending beyond what's in your account</li>
<li>or perhaps you don't have the habit of being organized, so you may forget to pay your bill some months</li>
<li>if you know yourself to be like this, maybe hold off on the credit card until you can improve your habits</li>
<li>be honest with yourself about your tendencies, so you can make better financial decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
<ul>
<li>what kind of lifestyle do you lead?</li>
<li>maybe you spend a lot of time socializing with friends over coffee or playing sports</li>
<li>is your spending in line with the lifestyle you imagine for yourself?</li>
<li>maybe your spending shows you go out to lots of clubs but in reality you don't enjoy doing that</li>
<li>take some time to think about what kind of lifestyle is important to you and look at your spending to see if it matches with what you think is important</li>
</ul>
